Average cost of attendance (academic year institutions),cost,attendance.academic_year,COSTT4_A,,,"The average annual total cost of attendance, including tuition and fees, books and supplies, and living expenses for all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. It is calculated from values in the IPEDS Institutional Characteristics and Student Financial Aid components. Separate metrics are calculated for academic-year institutions and program-year institutions. For academic-year institutions, average cost of attendance represents an average of all programs and includes only undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), average cost of attendance represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution for the length of the full program (see LProgram), regardless of program length, and it includes undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year.

Net tuition revenue per full-time equivalent student,school,tuition_revenue_per_fte,TUITFTE, ,,"Net tuition revenue (tuition revenue minus discounts and allowances) divided by the number of FTE students (undergraduates and graduate students) (http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/glossary/index.asp?id=854). Net tuition revenue is included in the IPEDS Finances component and FTE enrollment is included in the IPEDS 12-month enrollment component. This metric includes graduate students.

Proportion of faculty that is full-time,school,ft_faculty_rate,PFTFAC, ,,"Proportion of faculty that are employed full time, calculated from the IPEDS Human Resources component. This metric is calculated as the number of full-time nonmedical faculty divided by the total number of nonmedical faculty. Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent.

Percentage of undergraduates who receive a Pell Grant,aid,pell_grant_rate,PCTPELL, ,,"The proportion of undergraduates who received a Pell grant in the academic year, calculated from the IPEDS Student Financial Aid component. This metric is calculated by IPEDS as the quotient of the number of Pell grant recipients divided by the count of all undergraduates for either a fall enrollment cohort (for institutions that primarily follow an academic year calendar system) or a full-year enrollment cohort (for institutions that primarily follow a continuous enrollment or program-based calendar system). Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent. This metric is not available prior to the 2008–09 academic year.

Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. The retention rate is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled in the fall term of the current academic year divided by the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled in the fall of the prior academic year. This metric is not available prior to the 2004–05 academic year. Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent."
